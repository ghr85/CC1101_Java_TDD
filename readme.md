# Codeclan Week 11 Day 01
## Introduction to Java, IntelliJ , Java TDD and Single Classes
### Homework Assignment -Single Classes

#### Instructions

For this task you're given 3 simple classes to model : A Calculator, A Water Bottle and a Printer - see instructions.md.

Use TDD (JUnit) and the IntelliJ IDE to model these, while exploring conditionals and functions in java.

#### Order of Approach
* Read the brief, identify data and functions from nouns and verbs

* Test first, make it fail then code it to pass

* Consider the return types before writing any tests

* Consider the return types before writing any functions...yes...again...especially if there's a conditional

* Run the tests and git commit regularly

#### Notes
* be aware that IntelliJ is going to force your hand A LOT in this

* Worth checking on how to deal with conditionals i.e. true being void return, else being a string - external function is how I've gone here

* Liking Java already, feels stricter, stronger and more robust

* Practice in IntelliJ often - see if you can set it up as you did Atom i.e. plugins/keymappings/etc
